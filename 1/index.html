              <h4>Our Objectives</h4>
              <p>To provide :
                Better services to Transport Department as well as citizen
                Quick implementation of government policies from time to time
                Improved image of Government & Department
                Instant access of Vehicle/DL information to other government departments.The latest initiative has been to centralize both these applications for ensuring higher tranparency, security and reliability of operations through a countrywide unified database and provision of a highly citizen and trade centric web enabled environment. The new application being developed would provide for a multi-user environment wherein the end customers (citizens) may be empowered to perform most of the RTO related transactions (including payments) either from the comfort of home or from authorized third party service provider/s in their vicinity. </p>
